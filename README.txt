External Libraries Used:-
The following external libraries are used in this project: 
	numpy
	scikit-learn
	matplotlib

Prepare the input files:-
“The input files should be in current working directory as the python file is stored “.
	modifiedterms: Contains all the terms used
	trainClasses: Contains all docIds and Classes for training data
	testClasses: Contains all docIds and Classes for testing data
	trainMatrixModified: Prepocessed matrix which contains terms as rows and docs as columns
	testMatrixModified: Prepocessed matrix which contains terms as rows and docs as columns

The outcomes are printed and stored as plots in the current working directory. 

"BNB_manualConfusionMatrix.png" is custom confusion matrix.
"BNB_manualEvaluation.png" is custom evaluations.

"BNB_scikitConfusionMatrix.png" is Sklearn confusion matrix.
"BNB_scikitEvaluation.png" is SKlearn evaluations.

"BNB_manual.txt" has the Evaluation and confusion matrix of custom.
"BNB_scikit.txt" has the Evaluation and confusion matrix of sklearn.
